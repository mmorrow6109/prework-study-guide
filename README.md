# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

We've created a brief studyguide for the Coding Bootcamp by using various tools that we will become more familiar with over the course duration:

- What was your motivation? To learn hands on!
- Why did you build this project? To help
- What problem does it solve? Summarizes 4 key components of coding (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and GIT)
- What did you learn? A overhead view of how all of these components are used in the real world and interact with one another

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
